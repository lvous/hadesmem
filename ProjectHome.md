# IMPORTANT NOTICE: HADESMEM HAS MOVED! #

# Please find all future updates [here](https://github.com/RaptorFactor/hadesmem). #

## Introduction ##

HadesMem is a C++-based memory hacking library for Windows based applications, with the goal of providing a safe, generic, powerful, and efficient API. All components are useable on remote targets. Furthermore, all components compile for (and work natively on) both IA32 and AMD64.

## License ##

HadesMem is licensed under the MIT License (as of v2.0.0). Dependencies are under their respective (different) licenses. Please respect all license agreements.

## Call for Input ##

What would you like to see in HadesMem v2.0.0? Post feature requests on the issue tracker, or email me at raptorfactor@raptorfactor.com (please prefer the issue tracker if you can).

## Important Note ##

**Please use the stable releases or /branches/v1.0.0, as large amounts of functionality are missing in /trunk at the moment due to a rewrite for v2.0.0. Thank you.**

## Regarding v1.0.0 ##

I have had multiple people enquire about the 'fate' of HadesMem v1, so I want to make this clear... Whilst HadesMem v1 will not receive major new functionality any-more, it will still receive bug fixes and minor feature improvements (where applicable). So please continue to report and request things on the tracker. I am committed to supporting v1, even after v2 is stable.

## Download ##

In light of [this](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2013/05/a-change-to-google-code-download-service.html) announcement, I have mirrored all downloads onto Skydrive, and once download support is dropped from Google Code I will make all new releases there.
